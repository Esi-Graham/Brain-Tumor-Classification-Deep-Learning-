# Brain Tumor

## Problem Statement 

Brain tumors develop as a result of unregulated and rapid growth of cells. It is 12th among the top causes of cancer-related deaths in the global burden of diease (GBD) ranking, given the high death rate, financial burden on individuals and society,low survival rate, and impact on patients' quality of life. For efficient treatment planning and better patient outcomes, brain tumors should be detected early and accurately classified.

Conventional techniques for identifying brain cancers depend on radiologists manually analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which can be tedious, subjective and prone to human error. This is a major challenge in detection stems from the variation in the location, appearance, shape and size of the tumor. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) present a viable way to improve and automate the identification and categorization of brain tumors. 


## Objectives
This project seeks to use Convolutional neural net
works to:
1. Detect brain tumors
2. Classify brain tumors based on location of affected cells.

## Data Description

Recent advancements in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have opened new frontiers in medical imaging analysis. Our project harnesses this potential to revolutionize brain tumor detection and classification, paving the way for more personalized and precise treatment strategies.I built a CNN-based model and used other transfer learning architectures like VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet121 to detect brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary and no tumor) on MRI scans of patients.
